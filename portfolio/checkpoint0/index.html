        <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>I'm a graphics reporter at the Washington Post. I am also an adjunct professor at The University of Maryland, College Park. I was raised by NPR Visuals, and I'm an alumna of the beautiful University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>

        <p>Recently, I've been thinking about: Processes, aspirational skills, fostering collaboration, hiring and organizational hierarchy. Talk to me about any of these!</p>
